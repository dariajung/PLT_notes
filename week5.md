The next step of the group project is the language reference manual. Check in with your TA once a week to make sure you're on the right track for your project. 

How do you represent one of many things? We want our compiler to be able to handle many different programs. How do we describe certain things to it? 

- One way is continuously varying values; it's not a digital thing per se. The density is very high, but there is a lot of noise / little variations that shows up as data. 
- ENIAC: take wires and put them in certain places
- Different symbol per thing you want to represent. Works well when only a few things. 

What is the solution? Use a discrete combinatorial system (use combinations of a small number of things to represent MANY different things)

Every human writing system falls into this idea.

How do you describe only certain combinations? 
Compilers should only accept correct programs; how should a compiler check that its input is correct?
